			<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, my name is Daniel Martens and I'm a student at Red River College. I'm creating this website for a project in web development 1 but also as a portfolio to showcase my proficiency in web development, programming, database management, and system analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past I've performed many physical jobs such as construction, plumbing, HVAC, gas piping, pest control, and truck driving.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some hobbies that I fill my free time with include playing guitar, singing, exercising, cooking, reading, watching YouTube videos, thinking about philosophy, and painting things like this turtle with a castle on it's back.
